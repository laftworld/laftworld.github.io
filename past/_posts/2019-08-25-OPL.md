Time flows backward rather forward. Future is never known. All we know is the past. All the knowledge, concept, thought, and ideas are static. They are fixed and is flushed backward as time flows back. The only dynamics occur at the very moment of the present. Once you touch the tick, the chaos collapses and begins to flow. Then some ordered patterns reveal themselves. We call that knowledge. Knowledge is a set of patterns. It is like salient peaks of unutterable waves.

Therefore, if you settle yourself on the static, you will never learn the new. You can only learn when you observe the moment with unveiled eyes which is not aware of the prior knowledge.
