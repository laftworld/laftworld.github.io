| *Overview*  |


### Short review
The problem types (requests):
- "I am smart" : Turing test (social bot)
- "I have a question" : Information consumption (goal-oriented dialogues)
- "I need to get this done" : Task completion (goal-oriented dialogues)
- "What should I do?" : Decision support (goal-oriented dialogues)

The assistant should understand the intention and context behind the request.

### Challenge of NLP
- Ambiguity
- Paraphrase

### Deep Semantic Similarity Model (DSSM) for Sent2Vec
- [[Link]](http://aka.ms/sent2vec)

### Paradigm shift in NLP/IR
1. From symbolic to neural computation via semantic representation learning.
2. New Applications and Experience
3. End-to-end learning
4. Deep Reinforcement Learning
