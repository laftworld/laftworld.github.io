## Meta learning
What is meta learning? Meta learning is also called learning to learn. This is unlike many machine learning techniques. In particular, deep learning is a **parametric learning** which captures salient features from dataset and store the information as distributed representation in weight between each node. Meta learning captures the features of the featured dataset, so that it enables to converge fast and efficiently with being provided just a few shots of instances.

The objective of meta learning is similar to the one of transformer. The objective of transformer is generalizing the model to apply it into several different tasks, while the objective of meta learning is to reducing the learning cost of the generalization.

One more different issue between the transformers and meta learning is that transformers does not know which task will come when they pre-train the model, while meta learning knows which task will come when they train the model.

Meta learning is model based, optimization based, and
