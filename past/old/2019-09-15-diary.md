My research area is to find a way to merge the question answering and meta learning. What are they all about? This is to reduce the training cost so that the model can be converged into multiple tasks with less cost. Meta learning enables few-shot learning because it learns to learn to reduce the training cost. In particular, MAML (Model-agnostic meta-learning) is to maximize the gradient of gradient. What is the philosophy of meta learning? It would be from the wish to manipulate the training process with bird view. NÃ¤ive training is just training on predefined architecture and hyper-parameters, so it would be hard to figure out which constraint will be better for training process. For example, AutoML enables automated hyper-parameter search. For a wide perspective of view, AutoML can be included in one of meta learning techniques.

In this research, I would like to constraint myself into MAML. MAML is a sub-category of meta-learning. It tries to stop learning the parameters much before being fitted on given dataset, this over-generalization is to make the model more to be generalized on multiple tasks. The philosophy of MAML is that, MAML does not care classification, regression, or reinforcement learning. MAML can be applied on any ML techniques if learning is based on gradient descent. It is because MAML is to maximize gradient of gradient.

MAML gives a tension. It is like pulling out a rubber band. Once the tension is maximized, small release will make the model converge fast.

Question answering is retrieving information by providing meta information (i.e., keywords). Questioner request information which it does not have. Then how can questioner ask a question which he does not know? How can we give a question while we do not know the answer? How can we describe what we do not know before we know?

With this view, we assume that question is a
