Human behavior varies a lot. Nobody can describe complete patterns in one's life. But when you partially find some, you may construct the theory which may develop into a set of rules. It tells what you should do. It tells you what you should be. It always tells SHOULD so that you feel guilty whenever you get out of the bound. You feel incompetent whenever you can't meet the bound. It is like an invisible cage.

You may also be able to find some patterns in your life. You may discover the principle. Principle penetrates the patterns. Whenever your life gets out of the middle, the principle will tell you to regress to where you are supposed to belong to.

The principle is discovered by observation, while the rule is conserved by thought.
