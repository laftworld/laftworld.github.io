### Introduction
All right. This is my blog so I am going to tell anything I want. I am not going to care about grammar, and I am not going to care about fact and writing rules, either. This is because what I need right now is to be fluent at this thing.

The only way to be good at something is just doing it. What you care is to feel comfortable and be fluent at that thing. Once you accomplish that, you can absorb the unknown knowledge. This technique is introduced by [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=artist+way&qid=1567092877&s=gateway&sr=8-1){:target='blank'}, named 'The Artist Way'.

In this exercise mode, what you do is just doing it without worrying or fearing. Just write down every word for yourself. Do not care for any rule or grammar. Do not care someone else's view. When you grow and get stronger enough, then you can fix some points gradually. The rule and orders will block you to proceed. That is like that a horse is running behind its wagon. A horse is supposed to be ahead of a wagon.

### Research Topics
Question answering is a wide field. It becomes popular and popular. When we think about the topic, it seems very easy for we humans. However, this is quite a complicated topic for machines to solve. How would you feel if you are a machine?

Question answering is a kind of information retrieval task. When you google, what you do is putting in a series of keywords and pressing enter button. Then the server will return you a bunch of webpages, indicating the webpages contain the keywords you put. Since Google has launched the service from 1998, it has been 20 years. The amount of human-annotated search data might be tremendous. Thus the performance is well optimized for our daily usage.

However, there are more steps to achieve a higher state. We give and take information by asking question and answer. This is a simple give-and-take. But this task is quite hard for machines because the answer should be short and precise. When it comes to webpages, the logic is returning webpages which is a document. It does not have to be a precise sentence. Information retrieval is in document level rather sentence level.

The second shortcoming of traditional IR is that the recommendation logic is based on other people's preference, which is quite affordable for machines. When it comes to the sentence level, the variation of matching increases dramatically. It is not able to match each answer sentence for the corresponding question.
