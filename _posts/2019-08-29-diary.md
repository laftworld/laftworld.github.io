### Introduction
All right. This is my personal blog so I am going to tell anything I want. I am not going to care about grammar, and I am not going to care about fact and writing rules, either. This is because what I need right now is to being fluent at this thing.

The only way to be good at something is just doing it. What you care is to feel comfortable and be fluent at that thing. Once you accomplish that, you can absorb the unknown knowledge. This technique is introduced by [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Artists-Way-25th-Anniversary/dp/0143129252/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=artist+way&qid=1567092877&s=gateway&sr=8-1){:target='blank'}, named 'The Artist Way'.

In this exercise mode, what you do is just doing it without worrying or fearing. Just write down every words for yourself. Do not care any rule or grammar. Do not care someone else's view. When you grow and get stronger enough, then you can fix some points gradually. The rule and orders will block you to proceed. That is like that a horse is running behind its wagon.

Question answering is a kind of information retrieval task.
