Time flows backward rather forward. Future is never known. All we know is about the past. All the knowledge, concept, thought, ideas are static. The only dynamics occur at the very moment. Once you touch the moment, the chaos collapses and some pattern reveals themselves.

On the other hand, if you settle on the static things, you will never learn new things. You can only learn when you observe the moment with clear eyes.
