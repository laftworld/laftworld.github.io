Time flows backward rather forward. Future is never known. All we know is about the past. All the knowledge, concept, thought, and ideas are static. The only dynamics occur at the very moment of present. Once you touch the moment, the chaos collapses and some ordered patterns reveal themselves.

On the other hand, if you settle on the static things, you will never learn new things. You can only learn when you observe the moment with clear eyes without prior knowledge.
