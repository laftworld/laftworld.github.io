Each figure shows a decision boundary of classifying blue and red dots. The decision boundary of the above plot is not good for discriminating colored dots. The plot below shows the decision boundary which discriminates each dot well. The decision boundary above is an unlearned model, which is represented as $$\theta^0$$, while the decision boundary below is represented as $$\theta^*$$. $$\theta$$ is a symbol to represent the parameters of each model.
