# What I hope to be

What I hope to be... is that a person who enjoys learning. So that I could make ...

What I am building on
- a blog archiving my writings in Korean
	* **Education** for myself
- daily+weekly research report in English
	* **Research** in progress
	* **word classification problem** formulation in Math
	* **language corrector** in code

Saying
- Don't stop making something. 
- Don't pursue to be good at certain fields like Math or English. I am able to learn when I make something by my own hands.
