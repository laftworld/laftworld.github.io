# Say anything
I am in the laboratory. It is 12:27 am. This is a quite quiet place. Among over 50 seats, I am the only one who is sitting here.

Writing is amazing. Though I am not prepared to do speak the whole story, I can write from scratch. Once I begin writing a word, the next and another next word follow. That is due to the magic of **awareness**. This is a technique to become a child, which does not know but pure attention on the world. It is to see the whole, without knowledge, pre-conception, decision, or conclusion.

The most important principle of learning is forgetting. The mind is empty when it has no conclusion. Only its feeling and sensitivity remains. Seeing is difficult for adults, but easy for children. An only clear mind can penetrate the real without being distorted. Keeping the empty mind, this is the only thing when we learn.

Doing without thinking. Acting without worrying. Even death cannot be avoided. If the time leads me to death, then I am obedient to it.
