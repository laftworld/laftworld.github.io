The feature space is like a status window of a RPG game. When you pick a character, there are multiple status bars (e.g., HP, MP, etc). If two characters have the same status, then there is no way to distinguish the two.

Each status bar corresponds to each axis ($$x, y, z, u, v$$). The character is completely represented by its status of five dimensions.

The same metaphor works when it comes to classification task. Machines can distinguish if the image is cat or rat by looking at each status bar. If the two objects have the same status, then the machine says both of images are identical.
